# Build Framer prototypes with Mapbox  

_Last updated for Framer V93_

# Basic set up üîß 

### 1. Get an API access token
Sign up and get a Mapbox access token from [the token page](https://www.mapbox.com/studio/account/tokens/). We recommend creating a custom token for every project instead of using the default token. That way it's easier to track usage. Note your token must include all the public scopes.

### 2. Install `mapbox-gl` npm package
Create a new Framer project. In terminal, `cd` to your project and do `npm install mapbox-gl` to install the mapbox-gl package. Then create a new file named `npm.coffee` inside the `modules` folder. You will need to do this inside a text editor.  In `npm.coffee`, insert this line:

```
exports.mapboxgl = require "mapbox-gl"
```
To learn more about how Framer works with npm packages read [this section](mapboxgl.accessToken) of the Framer doc.

### 3. Import `mapboxgl` into your project

Open your project in Framer and insert:

```
mapboxgl = require("npm").mapboxgl
```

Now you can use the object of mapboxgl such as `mapboxgl.Map`. To learn more about the methods and properties available read the [Mapbox GL JS documentation](https://www.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/api/#map). 


# Explore examples üåü 

Open your project in Framer and copy paste the code in `app.coffee`. Note that you will still need to use your own access token.

# Select a map style üåç 

When adding a new `mapboxgl.Map` object, you will need to specify a map style URL. Select from one of the [six default map styles](https://www.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/api/#map) or design your own style with [Mapbox Studio](https://www.mapbox.com/mapbox-studio/), which gives you full control over color, font and other details. To use a custom style, go to the [style listing page](https://www.mapbox.com/studio/styles/), click on the hamburger icon, and copy paste the URL from the popover.

# Design @1x üñå 

Mapbox automatically loads 2x map tiles based on screen pixel density (retina or normal screen). When requesting a 2x pixel-sized map to fit in a 1x container, the map will appear shrunken and map labels may not be legible. It's better set your zoom level at 100% and always design @1x.
